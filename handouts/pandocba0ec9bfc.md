If you don't already have it, you should [install R and RStudio](//www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 

If you're on Windows, it's also great if you can install [Rtools](//cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). This gives you the tools to install packages from GitHub later on down the line.

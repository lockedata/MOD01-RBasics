# (PART) Preamble {-} 



# Introduction {-}
Welcome to the first book in Locke Data's series of books on R and data science! 

This first book introduces R, helps you get the most out of the RStudio programming environment, and teaches basic operations in R. 

Basic doesn't mean funky alas so if you want to skip ahead to the funky bits, you can get the next book.

# Prerequisites {-}
This book assumes no prior knowledge of programming.

Basic use of calculators and Excel is assumed. This is so that if we say things like `(5*5)-2` you know that I mean something like "subtract two from the result of five multiplied by five". If you're not sure about this type of thing you might struggle.

You should be able to install (or get installed) R, RStudio, and, if on Windows, RTools. You can code online at [r-fiddle.org](//www.r-fiddle.org/) but this might be unreliable. The instructions for installation in

# Conventions {-}

Throughout this book various conventions will be used.

In terms of basic formatting:

- This is standard text.
- `This is code or a symbol`
- <kbd>Keyboard Key</kbd>

This is a book about coding, so expect code blocks. Code blocks will typically look like. Note the result underneath - this is the result of executing the code block.

```{r}
"this is a code block"
```

There will also be callouts throughout the book. Some are for information, some expect you to do things.

```{block, type="protip"}
This is a tip about what I've just said.
```

```{block, type="glass"}
This is kind of like a tip but is for those break-the-glass, moments where things have gone very very wrong and you need to escape.
```

```{block, type="readerTODO"}
This is something I recommend you do as you're reading.
```

```{block, type="future"}
This let's you know that something I mention briefly will be followed up later, whether in this book or a later one.
```

```{block, type="TODO"}
If this is still here, someone at Locke Data needs to do something!
```

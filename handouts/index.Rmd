# About this book {-}
Welcome to the first book in Stephanie Locke of Locke Data's series on R and data science! 

This first book introduces R itself, helps you get the most out of the RStudio programming environment, and teaches the basics of getting things done in R. 

Already know the basics of R? You can skip right onto the next book in this series **[BOOK NAME/LINK here]**

# What you need to already know {-}
This book assumes no prior knowledge of programming, or R. A basic knowledge of mathematics will come in handy, but isn't required. You will need a good understanding of the use of calculators or Excel for mathematics.

You will need the required access to be able to install (or get installed) R, RStudio, and, if on Windows, RTools. You can code online at [r-fiddle.org](//www.r-fiddle.org/) but this might be unreliable. The instructions for installation can be found in the apendix of this book **[link to apendix here]**

# Steph Locke {-}
I am a Microsoft Data Platform MVP with over a decade of business intelligence and data science experience.

Having worked in a variety of industries (including finance, utilities, insurance, and cyber-security,) I've tackled a wide range of business challenges with data. I was awarded the MVP Data Platform award from Microsoft, as a result of organising training and sharing my knowledge with the technical community.

I have a broad background in the Microsoft Data Platform and Azure, but Iâ€™m equally conversant with open source tools; from databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, to analytical languages like R and Python.

# Locke Data {-}
I founded Locke Data, an education focused consultancy, to help people get the most out of their data. Locke Data aims to help organisations gain the necessary skills and experience needed to build a successful data science capability, while supporting them on their journey to better data science.

# Conventions {-}

Throughout this book various conventions will be used.

In terms of basic formatting:

- This is standard text.
- `This is code or a symbol`
- <kbd>This is a Keyboard Key!</kbd>

This is a book about coding, so expect code blocks. Code blocks will typically look like this:

```{r}
"this is a code block"
```

There will also be callouts throughout the book. Some are for information, some expect you to do things.

```{block, type="warning"}
Anything written here should be read carefully before proceeding.
```

```{block, type="protip"}
This is a tip relating to what I've just said.
```

```{block, type="glass"}
This is kind of like a tip but is for those break-the-glass, moments where things have gone very very wrong and you need to escape.
```

```{block, type="readerTODO"}
This is something I recommend you do as you're reading.
```

```{block, type="future"}
This let's you know that something I mention briefly will be followed up on later, whether in this book or a later one.
```

```{block, type="TODO"}
If this is still here, someone at Locke Data needs to do something!
```
